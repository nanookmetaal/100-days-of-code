**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 07, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I have started writing a blog article - focusing on staying concise and having flow in my writing. Identified a small issue with my Yeoman-based draft generator - it attempts to run `npm install` by default. I will add a fix to remove it and publish a new version to npm. Lastly, I need to get the github action to work that will automate publishing of my package on new release.

**Thoughts:**
